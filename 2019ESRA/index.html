		<h2> 10k MISSION </h2>
		<p>The Aerospace program at Clark is excited and proud to compete. Participation in this Spaceport America Cup provides opportunities to Clark community college students that very few other community colleges can provide. The program has generated considerable support from not only the student government, but also from highly influential individuals and companies within Washington state. For years Clark Aerospace has been recruiting first and second year college students to explore the field of rocketry. Participating in the Spaceport America Cup helps students discover a passion and lay down a roadway to success. </p>
		<p>Every year Clark Aerospace takes what was learned from previous designs and organizational decisions and improve upon them. In the past there had been too few students working on the rocket and the payload, resulting in sub-optimal delivery. This year the Electrical and Computer Science club at Clark College are working together with the Aerospace program to work on the payload, enabling the team to provide a superior payload relative to previous years. This year’s payload will be of a functional 3U form-factor that: is manufactured with industry standard tolerances, has Artificial Intelligence via a neural network the will be able to recognize and classify space debris, use reaction wheels and a cold gas thruster to adjust attitude for optimal positioning of solar arrays, and more. </p>
		<p> This year’s rocket team also has an increased number of team members. This allows for better time management and for students to maintain satisfactory academic performance, while creating a competitive rocket system. The rocket that will fly in the 2019 Spaceport America Cup will be less massive and lower in cost, while potentially achieving a smaller delta from our target apogee compared to last year. The air brake system is being rethought and improved. Additional hands on the project will allow Clark Aerospace to deliver a more complete rocket system to display to the judges, and to the world. </p>
		<p>We ranked 19th in launch performance in <a href="../2018ESRA/index.html">2018 Spaceport America cup </a> and are confident we will improve in 2019. <br /> Thank you for your time.</p>

	<p> The 2019 rocket team earned an honerable mention as "Ground Station + 3U Cubesat" - Team 91 Clark Aerospace" at <a href="http://www.soundingrocket.org/2019-sa-cup.html">Spaceport America 2019.</a> <br />
		out of 107 teams the technical report was rated 19th. The whole rocket project earned 449.5 points ending the team at 67th place.</p>

	<h2 class="chaptertitle"> Avionics </h2>
	<p>  The Avionics Bay (AV bay) in the 2019 rocket was designed to house 16 Samsung 5V lithium-ion batteries, an EggTimer Quantum Altimiter as the main altimeter, a Atlus-Metrum atimiter as a backup, and an Arduino Nano that will controll the airbrake motor and the nessasary sensors for it's function. 
	<br />	8 of the 5V batteries will run 40V to the motor controlling the air-brakes motion, and 4 will run 5V to the arduino Nano running the air-brakes and running diognosics. </p>

	<h2 class="chaptertitle"> Airbrakes </h2>
	<a href="../airbrakes.html"> List of other airbrake projects </a>
	<p> For the rocket this year we had to build airbrakes that would bring <a href="../2019ESRA/index.html"> the 2019 rocket </a> to 10,000 feet with high accuracy. Using information from the 2018 rocket we were able to make better design choices. </p>
	<br />
	<br />
	<p> The motor ran on 40Volts at a very low amperage. Ran by a arduino nano, and powered by batteries in the AV bay closer to the nose of the rocket, The motor would have been more than strong enough to move the airbrake fins. <br />
	The batteries supplied too many amps to the motor, and the wires on the inside of the motor melted. There was not enough time to fix the motor, so a dummy airbrake model was flown in the rocket in its place. </p>

	<h2 class="chaptertitle"> Payload </h2>
	<a href="../2019payload/index.html">Main article</a>
	<p> The theoretical 2019 functional payload was a 3U cubesat that was designed to, while in orbit, target and de-orbit other cubesats. With machine work from Mike Herlein, and software help from Keirce Matson, Nahn and Steven Arbuckle communications were settup between the payload and the ground-station. </p> 

	<h2 class="chaptertitle"> Launches </h2>
	<p> This rocket was only launched once: at the ESRA competition on june 20th. The rocket flew to an unknown height (approxamated around 300ft) before the rocket motor experienced a catastrophic falure. The parashoots did not deploy before the remaining pieces landed in a tree. </p>
	<!-- I would love to insert a video of the lauch here -->
	<h2 class="chaptertitle"> After the competition </h2>
	<p> The rocket team plans to re-use parts of this design in the 2020 rocket competition. Certain inconviences forced the team to use placeholder pieces for the airbrake subassembly, and the payload. This means that, although much of the rocket was damaged, these pieces may be re-used.</p>
