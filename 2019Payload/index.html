		<p>An early version of the 2019 payload.<br />The designed later had the batteries moved so that the payload could be made into the 3u form factor. </p>
	</div>
	<p> The payload made for the 2019 ESRA competittion was designed around the theoretical mission to de-orbit other cubesats while in orbit. 
	<br />	The payload included 3 reaction wheels, and cold-gass thruster for mobility. Solar sensors at the top would help the payload align solar panels (via the reaction wheels) to best capture the sunlight. An Arduino Nano, and a Rasperri Pi connected a temperature sensor, a 3-axis gyroscope and a gps sensor to a radio designed to be recieved on the <a href="../2019groundstation/index.html"> 2019 ground station </a>.
	<p> The payload team included Mike Herlein, Kierce Matson, Nahn, and Nick Henno. </p>

	<p> a nearby streamer, DasValdes, was kind enough to film the payload, and the ground station team talk about the payload and the ground station. This clip was taken from his twitch video. </p>
	<h2 class="chaptertitle"> After the competition </h2>
	<p> Due to other conserns, the payload was desided to not be included in the <a href="../2019ESRA/index.html"> 2019 rocket </a> and a dummy payload was used instead.
	<br /> As of writing the payload is still intact, and is being considered for re-use for the 2020 competition. </p>
