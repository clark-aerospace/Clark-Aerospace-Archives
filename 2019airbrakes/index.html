	<a href="../airbrakes.html"> List of other airbrake projects </a>
	<p> For the rocket this year we had to build airbrakes that would bring <a href="../2019ESRA/index.html"> the 2019 rocket </a> to 10,000 feet with high accuracy. Using information from the 2018 rocket we were able to make better design choices. </p>

	<br />
	<p> The motor ran on 40Volts at a very low amperage. Ran by a arduino nano, and powered by batteries in the AV bay closer to the nose of the rocket, The motor would have been more than strong enough to move the airbrake fins. <br />
	The batteries supplied too many amps to the motor, and the wires on the inside of the motor melted. There was not enough time to fix the motor, so a dummy airbrake model was flown in the rocket in its place. </p>
