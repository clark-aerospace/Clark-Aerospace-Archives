Inside the template folder There are some files that you may copy and modify to fit into the format you like

I would like the sidebar at the top to look like the sidebars on similar items, this will make some info easier to find. From top-to-bottom:
	for all main team-project pages
	Whenever possible the picture should be a group photo of the team posing with the rocket
	A list of team the member's names
	For rockets:
		the planned apogee height

When updating information, please update the endcard with your name and the current date. This makes it easier to find up-to-date information.
